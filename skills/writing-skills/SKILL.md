# Writing Skills

Use when creating/editing SKILL.md files.

Guidelines:
1. Frontmatter: unique `name`, concise `description` with trigger verbs and scope.
2. Body: 5–10 steps max; emphasize when to trigger and when *not* to.
3. Avoid ambiguity—state required artifacts (files, outputs) explicitly.
4. Keep tasks small; prefer checklists to prose.
5. Note interactions with other skills to reduce collisions.
6. Test by prompting the model with realistic tasks and confirming the right skill fires.
