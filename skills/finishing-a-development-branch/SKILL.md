# Finishing a Development Branch

Use when work is “done”.

Checklist:
1. Ensure working tree clean; no stray debug files.
2. Tests/linters green (or documented exception).
3. Update docs/changelog if behavior visible to users.
4. Summarize changes, risks, and verification for the reviewer/merger.
5. Rebase/sync with main if needed; resolve conflicts.
6. Hand off with PR-ready notes and link to test results.
