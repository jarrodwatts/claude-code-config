# Receiving Code Review

Use when feedback is received.

Steps:
1. Triage comments: group by theme and severity.
2. Apply quick fixes first; note any deferred items with owner/date.
3. For disagreements, propose an alternative and respond concisely.
4. Re-run tests relevant to touched areas.
5. Update handoff note with what changed and what remains.
