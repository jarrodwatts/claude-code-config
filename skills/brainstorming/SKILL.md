# Brainstorming

Use when the request is unclear, design-heavy, or multiple approaches exist.

Process:
1. Restate goal and constraints in 2–3 bullets.
2. List 5–7 distinct options; mix conservative and bold approaches.
3. Note pros, cons, and risks for each (keep tight).
4. Pick a recommendation with rationale and next validation step.
5. Capture open questions to resolve before building.
