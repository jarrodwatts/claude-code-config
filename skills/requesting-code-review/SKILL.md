# Requesting Code Review

Use when handing work off for review.

Checklist:
1. Summarize scope in 3–5 bullets (what/why/risks).
2. Point reviewers to key files/commits and known tricky areas.
3. State verification done (tests/linters/manual) and link to results.
4. Call out follow-ups/debt explicitly.
5. Keep the ask focused (e.g., correctness, API shape, perf).
